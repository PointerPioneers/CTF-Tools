# Python pwntools

pwntools, or pwn, is a Python library. According to its description, it's a "CTF framework and exploit development library". 

## How to use
`from pwn import *` imports most important stuff you need. Also automatically imports useful standard libraries, including `requests` and `time`.

## TCP/UDP connections
As a replacement for netcat, or the socket library, we can use pwn's `remote` function, for example:
```py
>>> conn = remote('nc.ctftime.org', 30000)
>>> conn.recvline()
b'hey there\r\n'
>>> conn.sendline(b'also hi to you')
>>> conn.recvuntil(b' ', drop=True) # receive until a space, drop means the space isn't included in the value
b'nice'
>>> conn.close()
```

## SSH
If a challenge involves automating a connection to SSH, the library can also be used:
```py
>>> shell = ssh('bandit0', 'bandit.labs.overthewire.org', password='bandit0', port=2220)
>>> shell['whoami'] # print connected user
b'bandit0'
>>> shell.download_file('/etc/motd')
>>> sh = shell.run('sh') # open shell via SSH
>>> sh.sendline(b'sleep 3; echo hello world;')
>>> sh.recvline(timeout=1)
b''
>>> sh.recvline(timeout=5)
b'hello world\n'
>>> shell.close()
```

## Binary exploitation
For the actual binary exploitation stuff, I haven't looked at it enough.
See https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/intro.html if you want to want to learn some more by yourself in the meantime. 

Some useful things to know:
- ELF means Executable and Linkable format, i.e. an executable (compiled program)
- Packing and unpacking (for integers) means converting between Python integers and their byte representation.
- The library contains an assembler and disassembler for different architectures and OS's (Operating System).
- The library contains tools for reading, interpreting and doing many things with ELFs (executable binaries), e.g. looking up addresses of functions.
